# Notes

## Terminology

1. 1 Epoch: 1 forward and backward pass of all training samples 
2. batch_size: number of training samples in one forward and backward pass 
3. number of iterations = number of passes, each passusing [batch_size] number of samples 

eg: 100 samples, batch0size = 20 ---> 100/20 = 5 iterations for 1 epoch

Making dataset
- using glob instead of listdir to make a csv file with all images, and their lables 
- Images are usually 640 x 480 in size, resizing them to 224 x 224 (suitable for resNet50 and other models)
- using a normalization as per ImageNet standard
